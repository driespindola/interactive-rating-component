### Useful resources

- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence tool that has assisted me when I encountered difficulties with code. It is important to note that it should only be utilized when one has a fundamental understanding of the coding process.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - "Please provide a comprehensive list of commands across various programming languages, along with corresponding examples. I utilize as a reference in instances where I have forgotten or lack knowledge of specific commands."
